## Technologies Used


The following technologies were used to create this:
- React
- HTML
- CSS


## My Process


I built the app with React components.

I experimented with debouncing with the date input fields, give them 200 ms before checking validation.

The validation was done in a function in a separate file. I returned errors in an array to allow for multiple errors to be returned in one run of the function. There is a fair amount of error checking, but I stopped short of checking for non-alpha characters. 

I feel that the code is overly complex, but it works and Iâ€™m ready to move on to the next challenge.

The CSS is messy, and definitely a skill I need more practice with.


## Credits

I would like to thank Frontend Mentor for providing this challenge, as it allowed me to practice my frontend development skills.
